### 🧠 Bright – Educational Mobile App
An interactive React-based educational app designed to help students with ADHD engage more effectively with their school material. Initially developed with two teammates during the OpenHackathon 2025, then fully redesigned and redeveloped from scratch as a solo project.

Bright is a mobile-first web app that delivers a structured learning journey through three interactive steps: watch, read, and play. It keeps students motivated with XP rewards and supports them through an integrated AI assistant offering clarifications and extra games.

- **Key Features**:
  - Full React.js SPA (Single Page Application)
  - AI-powered assistant using OpenAI API with contextual logic for clarifications and game suggestions
  - Speech synthesis via the Web Speech API
  - Componentized layout and reusable UI structure
  - Step-based progress indicator with XP feedback animations
  - Custom responsive design built with vanilla CSS modules
  - Modular routing per chapter and lesson step

## 🌸 Floraison – Interactive Website for a Floral Design Studio

A full-featured interactive website created as the final project of my front-end development bootcamp at SAE Athens. The site was designed for a fictional floral design studio and includes five main pages (Homepage, About, Services, Portfolio, Contact) and two subordinate content pages (FAQ, Privacy Policy) — all custom-built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal was to build a fully-functional, responsive, and accessible multi-page website with real-world features based on specific technical requirements.

- **Key Features**:
  - Fully responsive multi-page layout with consistent design system
  - Semantic HTML and accessibility-focused structure
  - Smooth CSS animations and one custom SVG loader animation
  - Local JSON data retrieval and rendering using Fetch API
  - Category-based filtering using vanilla JavaScript
  - Custom slider/gallery components for showcasing visual content
  - Client-side form validation with feedback messages
  - Codebase structured using the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for scalable CSS
